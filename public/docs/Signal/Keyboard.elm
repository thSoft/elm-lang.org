A signal of records indicating which arrow keys are pressed.

`{ x =-1, y = 0 }` when pressing the left arrow.<br>
`{ x = 1, y = 1 }` when pressing the up and right arrows.<br>
`{ x = 0, y =-1 }` when pressing the down,left, and right arrows.

Just like the `arrows` signal, but this uses keys `w`, `a`,
`s`, and `d`, which are common controls for many computer games.
