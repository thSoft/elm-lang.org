A list of touches. Each ongoing touch is represented by a set of `x`
and `y` coordinates and an identifier `id` that allows you to distinguish
between different touches. Each touch also contains the coordinates and time
of the initial contact (`x0`, `y0`, and `t0`) which helps compute more
complicated gestures.

The last position that was tapped. Default value is `{x=0,y=0}`. Updates
whenever the user taps the screen.

This is an early version of the touch library. It will likely grow
to include gestures that would be useful for both games and web-pages.
